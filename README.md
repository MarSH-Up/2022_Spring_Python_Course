# 2022 Spring Python Course

Hi Everyone! This repository will be just a kind introduction to Python for anyone who needs a brief introduction to the language. Most of the material will be in Spanish, but please send me a message on any social media if you need anything. 


How is it going to be the material structured? Each folder will have a specific topic and examples of it, and that should make it easier to search anything around. 


Note: The Universidad Iberoamericana Puebla is sponsoring all the material.
